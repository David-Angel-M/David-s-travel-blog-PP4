# PORTAFOLIO PROJECT - 4

# DAVID'S TRAVEL BLOG

### There is not much to say or add in here for this project as, AGAIN, unfortunatelly I still falling behind, this has happend since day 1 and is been very hard to get out of that loop. 

### I emailed Student Care maybe a month/month an half ago explaining my situation but they couldn't help me, the only option was to "freeze" the course but then I would not have access to the material which is not the help I needed.

### I sincerely apology for submitting this project like this, no one more then me feels bad about it, frustrated and dissapointed and for that I apologise
